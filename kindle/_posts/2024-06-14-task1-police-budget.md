The table provides information about the amounts of money funded for the police force in an area in the UK from three primary sources in 2017 and 2018. Additionally, the pie chart gives data about the percentages of the entire spending of this police force in these two years on three distinctive purposes.

Overall, the amounts of funding from all these three sources had increased to various extent. Furthermore, while spending on salaries occupied a smaller proportion in 2018, expenditure on technologies had received a larger percentage of the budget allocation.

Overall, the amount of money collected from all three surveyed sources had escalated, albeit at different rates. Also, this police force had decreased the amount of budget allocation for salaries in order to increase the percentage of spending on technologies.

*(Although the amount of funding from the national government had increased modestly, it had remained the largest source of money for this police force in both years. Specifically, 175.5 million pounds were provided in 2017, while around 177.8 were supplied in the year after.*

*The amount of money gathered from local taxes had increased the most significantly, surging from 91.2 million pounds in 2017 to 102.3 million pounds in 2018*

*Although other sources with the inclusion of grants had provided more money from 2017 to 2018, the increase was extremely modest. In 2017, this source of funding was responsible for 38 million pounds, and in 2018, the amount was 38.5 million pounds.*

*Thanks to all these increases, the total amount of money that the police force operated on had surged from 304.7 to 318.6 million pounds between 2017 and 2018.)*

Regarding the table, the national government was responsible for the largest amount of funding, increasing from 175.5 to 177.8 million pounds between these years. Although the amount of money collected from the local taxes had remained smaller, it had observed the most significant increased, from only 91.2 to more than 100 million pounds after only one year. Other sources with the inclusion of grants provided a stable amount of funding, slightly inclining from 38 to 38.5 million pounds. These increased had expanded the total budget of the police from 304 million pounds to 318.6 million pounds.

The pie chart also witnesses notable changes regarding the budget allocation of this police force. Although paying salaries still consumed the most resources in both years, there had been a small decline in its proportion from 75% to 69%. This plunge had allowed the police to increase spending on technologies, initially comprising only 9% in 2017 but up to 14% in 2018. The percentage of spending used for buildings and transport had remained unchanged at 17%.

One of the most remarkable features of the charts and the table is that thanks to the expansion of the budget from having more fundings, the increase in the budget allocation percentage of technologies means that a lot resources had been put into improving this aspect of the police force.

**The table provides details about the sources of funding for the police in a specific area of the UK in 2017 and 2018, while the pie charts illustrate how this budget was allocated across three categories: salaries, technology, and buildings/transport.**

**Overall, total police funding increased over the period, with all sources contributing more. Although salaries remained the largest expense, their proportion decreased, allowing a greater share of the budget to be allocated to technology.**

In terms of funding sources, the national government remained the primary contributor, with funding rising slightly from £175.5 million in 2017 to £177.8 million in 2018. Local taxes saw the most substantial increase—from £91.2 million to £102.3 million—while funding from other sources, such as grants, remained relatively stable, increasing marginally from £38 million to £38.5 million. As a result, the total police budget rose from £304.7 million to £318.6 million.

With regard to spending, salaries for officers and staff made up the largest proportion in both years, though this fell from 75% in 2017 to 69% in 2018. In contrast, the share allocated to technology nearly doubled, increasing from 8% to 14%. Expenditure on buildings and transport remained unchanged at 17% across both years.

**A notable trend is that the overall budget increase enabled greater investment in technology, reflecting a possible strategic shift in operational priorities within the police force.**
