Some individuals claim that selling food or beverages that have been proven by science to inflict damage upon consumers’ health should be prohibited. Personally, I partly agree with this suggestion based on some reasons that are provided in this essay.

Nowadays, as junk food and high caloric beverages are highly accessible and affordable, they directly increase the rate of obesity and illnesses-related to this health problems, such as cardiovascular diseases or diabetes. These health conditions strain our healthcare system and make it hard for people to contribute positive to society through working. Since people primarily get access to these damaging foods in physical stores, banning them is highly effective in ensuring a higher well-being level for the general public

On the other hand, banning all potentially damaging foods and drinks can be devastating to many people, leading to a call for a more cautious approach. In many nations around the world, especially developing ones, food production is a major economic sector that contributes to the livelihood of millions of people. Since the number of foods and drinks that can damage people’s health is extremely massive, banning all of them would take away the jobs of countless individuals, elevating the rate of unemployment, poverty, and social chaos.

In conclusion, although there are opinions that foods and drinks that may pose a health risk to people’s health should be banned from selling, I believe that this approach can be beneficial but must be applied selectively. while this measure can reduce accessibility to problematic foods and beverages, it can disrupt the ability to make a living of many individuals around the world, making it impractical if applied universally.
